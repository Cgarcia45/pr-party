# CSP 200 Pull Request Party

For this in-class activity, you will do the following:

1. Fork this repository on GitHub

2. Clone your fork on the class server

3. Create a new branch to make a contribution

4. Make the following changes (in your new branch). Make a separate commit for
   each change.

   - add a new file in the "greetings" directory which defines a function that
     prints out a message containing your name

   - define a new function in the "main.py" file that calls the library function
     defined in the previous step

   - add a line to the main function in "main.py" that calls your newly defined
     function; check that your changes work with the command `./main.py`

5. Push your branch to your forked repository, and start a Pull Request (PR).

6. Check the status of your PR. If a conflict arises, fix it!

7. After your PR has been merged, be sure you know how to pull changes from the
   original GitHub repository into your fork, then into your local repository.

By the end of the class, make sure that your PR has been submitted and merged!
(I'll be doing this live.)
